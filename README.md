# One Page Reader

This add-on attempts to automatically loaded news article in one site. The add-on has been developed because various (especially German) websites are publishing article divided in multiple pages.

The addon is created for Firefox and was tested on v58.0.1 on Windows 10.

## Tested browsers
* Firefox v58.0.1, Windows 10
* Chrome v64.0, Windows 10

## Supported websites
* FAZ.net
* golem.de
* heise.de
* sueddeutsche.de
* wiwo.de (Wirtschaftswoche)
* zeit.de
* 11freunde.de

Additional websites can be added in *js/domains.js*.

## Known issues/todos
* Golem.de: Video scripts for videos on pages > 1 are not included and therefore missing
* Test code is missing
